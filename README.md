# Credit Risk Analysis

In this analysis we are trying to predict the credit risk of applicants. To obtain this information we have used six different machine learnign models to obtain the hightes performance assestment. 

# Results 
**Oversampling:** this models displays a 65% accuracy score with a 1% precision and 61% recalll on high risk applicants.

**Undersampling:** this models displays a 62% accuracy score with a 1% precision and 61% recalll on high risk applicants, which is the same performance of the oversampling model.
